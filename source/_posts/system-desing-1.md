CAP Theorem is a concept about distributed database system that we cannot build a general data store that is continually available, sequentially consistent, and tolerant to any partition failures.

We can only build a system that has two of the following three guarantees:

- **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error
- **Availability**: Every request receives a (non-error) response, without the guarantee that it contains the most recent write
- **Partition tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite an arbitrary number of messages being dropped (or delayed) by the network between nodes

However, in a distributed system, partitions canâ€™t be avoided. So usually you'll need to make a software tradeoff between consistency and availability.

**CP - consistency and partition tolerance**

Waiting for a response from the partitioned node might result in a timeout error. CP is a good choice if your business needs require atomic reads and writes.

**AP - availability and partition tolerance**

Responses return the most recent version of the data available on a node, which might not be the latest. Writes might take some time to propagate when the partition is resolved.

AP is a good choice if the business needs allow for eventual consistency or when the system needs to continue working despite external errors.
