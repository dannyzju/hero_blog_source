## I. Python for Beginners
### Introduction
Python is a language with widespread adoption and lots of uses.

### Python Variable
Example: 
```python
    name = "Danny"
```

### Fuctions and Objects
Example:
``` python
def my_function_name():
    print("this is the function body")
```

### Syntax and Style
Every programming language has specific words and rules for using them which we call syntax. Some languages also have rules about how the code should look. Python has both of these!
Blocks are indented one extra step.Each indentation step should be four spaces (just hit tab)

```python
def answer_the_phone():
    greeting = "Hi, this is Kenneth. Who is this?"
    print(greeting)
```

### The Python Shell
In Mac, just type "python" in terminal to enter python shell, and type "exit()" to quit.

### Running Python Scripts
Example to run a python script in python shell:
treehouse:~/workspace$ python hello_world.py

### Errors:
**NameError: **
Example: 5 + x
Got the error because the x is not defined.

**TypeError: 5 + 'a'**
Got the error because 5 and 'a' are different types, and can not be added.

**SyntaxError:**
Example: print("Hello)
Got the error because of missing the syntax "
