#### Why Code Review?
- Developers know their code will be evaluated, so they work harder.
- It improves a developer's own programming skills.
- It's an opportunity for mentoring, so the programmers you work with get smarter (and thus, more fun to hang around with).
- It creates consistency and a culture of quality across the project.
- It encourages team bonding.

#### How to run an effective code review?
- Review fewer than 200–400 lines of code at a time
- Aim for an inspection rate of fewer than 300–500 LOC per hour
- Take enough time for a proper, slow review, but not more than 60–90 minutes
- Be sure that authors annotate source code before the review begins
- Establish quantifiable goals for code review, and capture metrics so you can improve your processes
- Use checklists, because they substantially improve results for both authors and reviewers
- Verify that the defects are actually fixed
- Foster a good code review culture in which finding defects is viewed positively
- Beware of the Big Brother effect
- Review at least part of the code, even if you can't do all of it, to benefit from The Ego Effect
- Adopt lightweight, tool-assisted code reviews
